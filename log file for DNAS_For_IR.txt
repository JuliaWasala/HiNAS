v1->v2: 
1) untie the cell structure, cells in different layers use different architectures and cells in the same layer share the same structure. 
2) use residual learning. Predicting the residuals between high quality images and low quality images, accelerating the conversicing speed and improving performance.
3) bulid new search space. Replacing deformable conv with relatively normal conv operations, as deformable conv is time consuming.
4) new activation function. using Leaky RelU instead of ReLU in new version.

v2->v3
1) optimizer, replacing sgd optimizer with adam optimizer
2) sigmoid acitivation. Abandoning the sigmoid activation function in the last conv layer.

v3->v4
1) upsample sample method is set to bicubic
2) more flexible width change
